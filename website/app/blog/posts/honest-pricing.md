## The Subscription Trap

Here's a dirty secret of the SaaS industry: a meaningful percentage of revenue comes from people who forgot they're paying.

It's not malicious, exactly. Companies don't set out to charge people who aren't using the product. But they also don't go out of their way to stop it. The cancellation flow has six pages. The "downgrade" button is mysteriously hard to find. And the inactivity emails? They're designed to re-engage, not to say "hey, maybe you should cancel."

We think that's wrong, especially for something as personal as a journal.

## What We Do Differently

LogLife has a simple policy: if you stop using the product, we'll cancel your subscription for you.

Here's how it works:

1. **We notice.** If you haven't logged anything in a while, our system flags it.
2. **We reach out.** You'll get an email saying: "Hey, we noticed you haven't been using LogLife. Want to pause, downgrade, or cancel?"
3. **We act.** If we don't hear back, we'll downgrade or cancel on your behalf.

No hoops. No guilt trips. No "we're sorry to see you go" emails with a hidden "actually, keep charging me" button.

## Why Trust Matters Here

A journal is one of the most personal digital products you can use. You're sharing your thoughts, feelings, struggles, and wins with a piece of software. That requires an enormous amount of trust.

And trust is built on small things. It's built on transparency about what data you store. On open-sourcing your code so people can verify your claims. On pricing that doesn't have fine print.

If we're going to ask people to share their inner lives with LogLife, the least we can do is be honest about what we charge them.

## The Actual Cost Structure

LogLife's pricing is straightforward:

- **Self-Hosted: $0/forever.** Open source. Bring your own API keys. Run it on your own infrastructure. We don't make money from this tier, and that's fine — it keeps us honest.
- **Hosted: $19/month.** We handle hosting, updates, and support. API usage is included. This is where most people land.
- **Unlimited: $49/month.** For heavy users who want unlimited API usage, priority support, and advanced features.

The subscription covers hosting, development, monitoring, and support. We don't mark up API costs. We don't resell your data. Monthly receipts show exactly what you used and what you paid for.

## Cancel Anytime, Really

"Cancel anytime" is one of those phrases that every SaaS company says and few actually mean. Here's what it means at LogLife:

- **One click.** No phone call required. No survey. No "special offer to stay."
- **30-day data deletion.** After you cancel, all your data is automatically deleted in 30 days. If you want it sooner, one click.
- **Full export.** Before you go, download everything. It's your data.

## The Bet We're Making

We believe that if LogLife is genuinely useful, people will pay for it. And if it's not useful, we don't deserve their money.

That's not idealism. It's just good business. A customer who pays because they're getting value is worth ten customers who pay because they forgot to cancel. They tell their friends. They give feedback. They help us build a better product.

Auto-cancellation isn't a loss. It's a filter for the kind of relationship we want to have with the people who use LogLife.
