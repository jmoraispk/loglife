## The Paradox of Choice

OpenClaw ships with over 50 skills. File management, web browsing, code execution, API integrations, database queries, and much more.

But here's the thing: most users only need 5-10 skills.

## Why More Isn't Better

1. Cognitive overhead - More options means more confusion
2. Security surface - Each skill is a potential vulnerability
3. Performance - Unused skills still consume resources
4. Maintenance - More skills = more things that can break

## Our Curation Philosophy

At AutoClaw, we believe in opinionated defaults:

- Start with essential skills enabled
- Make it easy to add more when needed
- Provide clear documentation for each skill
- Remove skills that cause more problems than they solve

## The Essential Skill Set

For most users, we recommend starting with:

1. File System - Read, write, navigate files
2. Shell - Execute commands
3. Web Browser - Research and automation
4. Code Editor - Write and modify code
5. Git - Version control

## Conclusion

Don't enable skills "just in case." Start minimal, add as needed. Your AI agent will be faster, safer, and easier to understand.
