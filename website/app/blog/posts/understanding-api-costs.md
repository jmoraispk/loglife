## The Hidden Cost of AI Agents

When you run an AI agent, every interaction costs money. Understanding these costs is crucial for budgeting and optimization.

## How Pricing Works

### Anthropic (Claude)
- Input tokens: $3 per million tokens (Claude 3 Sonnet)
- Output tokens: $15 per million tokens
- Context window: 200K tokens

### OpenAI (GPT-4)
- Input tokens: $10 per million tokens (GPT-4 Turbo)
- Output tokens: $30 per million tokens
- Context window: 128K tokens

## Real-World Cost Examples

A typical coding session with an AI agent might involve:
- 50 back-and-forth messages
- Average 2,000 input tokens per message
- Average 1,500 output tokens per response

Total cost: Roughly $2-5 per session depending on the model.

## Tips for Cost Optimization

1. Choose the right model - Use smaller models for simple tasks
2. Be concise - Shorter prompts = lower costs
3. Cache when possible - Avoid redundant API calls
4. Set budgets - Use provider dashboards to set spending limits
