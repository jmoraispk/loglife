## Plugin configuration

The plugin accepts three config values in `openclaw.json` under `plugins.entries.loglife.config`:

| Key | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apiKey` | Yes | — | Shared secret for authenticating dashboard requests |
| `agentId` | No | `"main"` | Which agent's sessions to serve |
| `multiUserDir` | No | `~/.openclaw/multi-user/` | Directory containing `users.json` and `generated.json` for [multi-user setup](/architecture#multi-user) |

Set values with the OpenClaw CLI:

```bash
cd ~/openclaw
./openclaw.mjs config set plugins.entries.loglife.config.apiKey "your-key"
./openclaw.mjs config set plugins.entries.loglife.config.agentId "main"
```

## Website environment variables {#website-env}

The Next.js website needs two environment variables to connect to the plugin. Create a `.env` file in `loglife/website/`:

```bash .env
OPENCLAW_API_URL=http://localhost:18789
OPENCLAW_API_KEY=<your key from plugin installation>
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
cd loglife/website
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The dashboard will now fetch session data through the plugin.

## Production deployment (Vercel)

The website deploys to Vercel automatically on every push to `main`. Set these environment variables in your [Vercel project settings](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables):

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `OPENCLAW_API_URL` | `https://api.yourdomain.com` (see [Networking](/networking)) |
| `OPENCLAW_API_KEY` | The key from [plugin installation](/plugin-installation) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Clerk publishable key |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Clerk secret key (server-side only) |

<Info>
  In production, the `OPENCLAW_API_URL` should point to your HTTPS domain, not `localhost`. See the [Networking guide](/networking) for how to set up Caddy as a reverse proxy with SSL.
