## Overview

LogLife uses OpenClaw's media understanding system to transcribe voice messages. OpenClaw supports multiple STT providers (OpenAI, Deepgram, Groq, Google) and also allows **CLI-based providers** configured in `openclaw.json`.

We ship an AssemblyAI CLI script in the plugin for users who want better accuracy and lower cost.

## Benchmark Results

Tested on the same audio files, 10 runs per provider, from a European server.

Models: **OpenAI gpt-4o-mini-transcribe** vs **AssemblyAI Universal-2**.

Short = 30-second audio (58 KB). Long = 15-minute audio (850 KB).

| | OpenAI (short) | AssemblyAI (short) | OpenAI (long) | AssemblyAI (long) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Min | 832ms | 1,581ms | 7,604ms | **5,595ms** |
| Avg | 1,225ms | 2,242ms | 10,087ms | **6,254ms** |
| Max | 2,233ms | 2,977ms | 15,096ms | **6,971ms** |

### Decision

| | OpenAI | AssemblyAI |
|---|---|---|
| Short audio | Faster | Slightly slower |
| Long audio | Slower | **Significantly faster** |
| Cost | $0.003/min ($0.18/hr) | **$0.0025/min ($0.15/hr)** |
| Languages | ~57 | 99 |
| Free tier | No | ~185 hrs/month |

**AssemblyAI Universal-2** is the default audio provider for LogLife -- better accuracy, lower cost, and faster on longer audio.

## Setup

### 1. Set your API key

```bash
export ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

Add this to your shell profile or to the OpenClaw systemd service environment.

### 2. Configure OpenClaw

Add the following to your `openclaw.json` (usually `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`):

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "media": {
      "audio": {
        "models": [
          {
            "type": "cli",
            "command": "/path/to/loglife/plugin/assemblyai-transcribe",
            "args": ["{{MediaPath}}"]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/loglife` with the actual path to your LogLife installation.

### 3. Restart the gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

Voice messages will now be transcribed via AssemblyAI.

## Running Your Own Benchmark

The benchmark script is included in the plugin directory:

```bash
node plugin/benchmark-stt.mjs \
  --audio /path/to/audio.ogg \
  --openai-key sk-... \
  --assemblyai-key ... \
  --runs 10
```

Pass only the keys you want to test. Omit a key to skip that provider.
