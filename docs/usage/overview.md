## 💡 Quick Tips

*   **Be Casual**: You don't need strict commands. Just say "add a goal to read more" or "here is a voice note".
*   **Set Reminders**: Tell the bot "remind me at 9pm" to set your daily check-in time.
*   **Check Progress**: Ask "how did I do this week?" to get a summary of your performance.
