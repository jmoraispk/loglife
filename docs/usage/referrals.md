## 🔄 What Happens Next?

LogLife takes care of the introduction so you don't have to.

1.  **System Check**: We verify if they are already a user.
2.  **Welcome Message**: If they are new, LogLife sends them a friendly greeting explaining how to start tracking goals.
3.  **Confirmation**: You get a thumbs-up message confirming the invite was sent.

!!! tip "No Spam"
    We only send **one** welcome message. We won't pester your friends if they don't reply.
