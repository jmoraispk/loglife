## Overview

The LogLife plugin registers three HTTP routes on the OpenClaw gateway:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/loglife/sessions` | GET | Look up session data by phone, session ID, or key |
| `/loglife/verify/send` | POST | Send a 6-digit verification code via WhatsApp |
| `/loglife/verify/check` | POST | Validate a verification code |

## Authentication

All endpoints require a **Bearer token** in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

The API key is configured in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `plugins.entries.loglife.config.apiKey`. Generate one with:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

## Architecture

The API runs inside the OpenClaw gateway process — there is no separate service. The LogLife dashboard (hosted on Vercel) calls these endpoints through its own Next.js API routes, which add the Bearer token server-side. End users never interact with the plugin API directly.

```
Browser → Next.js API route → LogLife Plugin (OpenClaw gateway)
```

## Security model

- **Bearer token auth** on every request (timing-safe comparison)
- **Clerk auth** on the Next.js proxy layer (only logged-in users)
- **Rate limiting** on verification code sends (1 per phone per 60s)
- **Single-use codes** deleted immediately after successful verification
- **5-minute TTL** on verification codes

Documenting these endpoints publicly is safe because knowing the URL structure and parameters is useless without the API key, which is only stored server-side.
