## Overview

The LogLife plugin registers four HTTP routes on the OpenClaw gateway:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/loglife/sessions` | GET | Look up session data by phone, session ID, or key |
| `/loglife/verify/send` | POST | Send a 6-digit verification code via WhatsApp |
| `/loglife/verify/check` | POST | Validate a verification code |
| `/loglife/register` | POST | Register a new user in the multi-user configuration |

## Authentication

All endpoints require a **Bearer token** in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

The API key is configured in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `plugins.entries.loglife.config.apiKey`. Generate one with:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

## Architecture

The API runs inside the OpenClaw gateway process — there is no separate service. The LogLife dashboard (hosted on Vercel) calls these endpoints through its own Next.js API routes, which add the Bearer token server-side. End users never interact with the plugin API directly.

```
Browser → Next.js API route → LogLife Plugin (OpenClaw gateway)
```

## User registration flow

When a new user signs up on the dashboard, the verification and registration endpoints work together:

1. Dashboard calls `/loglife/verify/send` with the user's phone number
2. Plugin sends a 6-digit code via WhatsApp
3. User enters the code on the dashboard
4. Dashboard calls `/loglife/verify/check` to validate the code
5. On success, dashboard calls `/loglife/register` with the phone and user's name
6. Plugin adds the user to the multi-user config and triggers a gateway hot-reload
7. The user can now send messages to the bot via WhatsApp

No gateway restart is required — the hot-reload picks up the new configuration immediately.

## Security model

- **Bearer token auth** on every request (timing-safe comparison)
- **Clerk auth** on the Next.js proxy layer (only logged-in users)
- **Rate limiting** on verification code sends (1 per phone per 60s)
- **Single-use codes** deleted immediately after successful verification
- **5-minute TTL** on verification codes
- **Idempotent registration** — registering an already-registered phone returns success without duplicating

Documenting these endpoints publicly is safe because knowing the URL structure and parameters is useless without the API key, which is only stored server-side.
