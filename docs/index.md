# AutoClaw

> Deploy & Run OpenClaw in minutes.

AutoClaw is a managed deployment platform for [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.io), the powerful open-source personal AI assistant. We handle all the infrastructure complexity so you can focus on using your AI agent.

## What is AutoClaw?

AutoClaw takes OpenClaw—a feature-rich AI assistant with 20+ chat channels and 50+ skills—and makes it accessible to everyone through:

- **One-click deployment** — No SSH, no server rental, no networking hassles
- **Managed infrastructure** — We provision servers, install OpenClaw, and configure Tailscale networking
- **Unified dashboard** — Access OpenClaw's native UI plus centralized API cost tracking
- **Curated skills** — Start with vetted, security-reviewed integrations
- **Automatic updates** — Zero-surprise upgrades handled by us

## Why AutoClaw?

Setting up OpenClaw manually requires:
- Renting and configuring a VPS
- Setting up SSH, accounts, dependencies, and networking
- Hoping OpenClaw builds correctly
- Manually tracking API keys and costs across providers
- Managing security risks from unverified community skills
- Debugging for hours when something breaks

**AutoClaw handles all of this for you.** Click deploy, and you're live in minutes.
