description: "Set up the LogLife dashboard and OpenClaw plugin from scratch"
---

LogLife runs as two independent pieces: a **Next.js website** hosted on Vercel (marketing site + dashboard) and an **OpenClaw plugin** that serves session data from your server. The dashboard talks to the plugin through a secure API — your server address and key never reach the browser.

## Architecture

    proxy -->|"Bearer token"| plugin["LogLife plugin\n/loglife/sessions"]
    plugin --> sessions["sessions.json"]
    gw["OpenClaw gateway\nport 18789"] --- plugin
```

The website is a static marketing site for most visitors. When a logged-in user opens the dashboard, the Next.js API route proxies requests to the OpenClaw plugin. The plugin reads `sessions.json` and returns session data. Authentication uses a shared Bearer token — the key lives in your server's OpenClaw config and in Vercel's environment variables, never in client-side code.
