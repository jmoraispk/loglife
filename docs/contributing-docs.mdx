## Overview

The docs live in the `docs/` directory of the LogLife monorepo and are built with [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com). They are deployed automatically to [docs.loglife.co](https://docs.loglife.co) whenever changes are merged into `main`.

## How to update

All pages are `.mdx` files in `docs/`. The full Mintlify syntax reference is stored in `.cursor/rules/mintlify.mdc`, so if you're using Cursor (or another AI editor that supports rule files) you can just ask it to make changes and it will follow the correct syntax. See [AI rules](/ai-rules) for details.

To add or edit a page manually:

1. Create or edit an `.mdx` file in `docs/`.
2. Add [frontmatter](https://mintlify.com/docs/page) at the top of the file (`title`, `description`).
3. If you're adding a new page, register it in `docs/docs.json` under the appropriate navigation group.

## How to preview locally

```bash
cd loglife/docs
mintlify dev
```

This starts a local server (usually at `http://localhost:3000`) with hot reload. Changes to `.mdx` files are reflected immediately.

<Note>
  You need the Mintlify CLI installed globally: `npm i -g mintlify`.
</Note>

## Where it shows up

| Environment | URL | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Local preview | `localhost:3000` | `mintlify dev` |
| Production | [docs.loglife.co](https://docs.loglife.co) | Merge to `main` |

Once your changes are merged into the `main` branch, Mintlify automatically rebuilds and deploys the site. No manual deploy step is needed.
