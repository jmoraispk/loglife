## Local setup

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - Node.js 19+, pnpm
  - OpenClaw installed (see [Self-hosting](/self-hosting))
</Info>

<Steps>
<Step title="Start the OpenClaw gateway">

```bash
cd ~/openclaw
./openclaw.mjs gateway --allow-unconfigured
```

The gateway runs on port 18789 by default. The LogLife plugin is loaded automatically if installed (see [Self-hosting](/self-hosting) for plugin installation).
</Step>

<Step title="Start the website">

```bash
cd loglife/website
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The dashboard is at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit, restart, test">

When you change `plugin/index.ts`, restart the local gateway to pick up the changes. The website hot-reloads automatically.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Plugin deployment

When plugin changes are pushed to `main`, the GitHub Actions workflow:

1. SSHes into the production server
2. Pulls the latest code
3. Restarts the OpenClaw gateway (graceful — waits for in-flight replies to drain)
4. Runs a health check against the plugin endpoints

**Sessions are not lost on restart** — they are persisted to disk in `sessions.json`. In-memory verification codes are cleared, but that's expected (5-minute TTL, users simply re-request).

### Health checks

The deploy workflow verifies two things after each restart:

- `GET /loglife/sessions?phone=healthcheck` returns 404 (plugin loaded, searched, found nothing)
- `POST /loglife/verify/check` with dummy data returns 200 (verify endpoint loaded)

If either check fails, the deploy is marked as failed in GitHub Actions.

### Website deployment

The website deploys to Vercel automatically on push to `main`. No gateway restart needed — the website is a separate deployment that connects to the plugin via `OPENCLAW_API_URL`.

## Docs preview

To preview documentation changes locally:

```bash
npm i -g mint
cd docs
mint dev
```

A local preview will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
