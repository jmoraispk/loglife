## The Paradox of Choice

LogLife could integrate with hundreds of tools and data sources. Health trackers, productivity apps, social media, smart home devices, and much more.

But here's the thing: most users only need 3-5 integrations to get started.

## Why More Isn't Better

1. Cognitive overhead — More options means more confusion about what to set up
2. Data noise — Too many signals dilute the patterns that matter
3. Privacy surface — Each integration is a potential data exposure
4. Maintenance — More integrations mean more things that can break

## Our Curation Philosophy

At LogLife, we believe in opinionated defaults:

- Start with core chat-based capture (zero integrations needed)
- Make it easy to add health data (Oura, Apple Health) when ready
- Provide clear documentation for each integration
- Remove integrations that add noise rather than signal

## The Essential Starting Point

For most users, we recommend starting with:

1. Chat capture — Your primary journaling surface (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.)
2. Voice notes — Quick audio entries that get auto-transcribed
3. Calendar — See how your time maps to your journal entries
4. One health tracker — Oura, Apple Health, or similar for sleep/activity data

## Conclusion

Don't enable integrations "just in case." Start minimal, journal for a week, then add data sources as you discover what patterns you want to track. Your journal will be cleaner, more private, and more meaningful.
