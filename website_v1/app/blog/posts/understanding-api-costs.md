## Real-World Cost Examples

A typical day of journaling with LogLife might involve:
- 5-10 voice note transcriptions
- 3-5 AI-generated highlight summaries
- 1-2 conversational queries about your data

Total cost: Roughly $0.10-0.30 per day depending on usage and model.

## Tips for Cost Awareness

1. Voice notes are efficient — Short audio gets transcribed cheaply
2. Highlights are batched — Daily summaries are generated once, not repeatedly
3. Queries scale — Asking about your week uses context efficiently
4. Self-host option — Bring your own API keys and pay providers directly

## LogLife's Approach to Costs

LogLife includes transparent cost tracking so you always know what's happening. For hosted users, API usage is included up to fair use limits. For self-hosted users, you bring your own keys and pay providers directly — we never add markup.
