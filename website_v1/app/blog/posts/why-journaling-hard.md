## The Problem with Building a Journaling Habit

Journaling shouldn't require willpower. Yet, for most people trying to maintain a consistent practice, the journey looks something like this:

1. Download a journaling app — Navigate confusing feature sets, pick from dozens of options
2. Set up a routine — Try to carve out 15-30 minutes every evening
3. Face the blank page — Stare at an empty screen, unsure what to write
4. Lose momentum — Miss a few days, feel guilty, abandon the habit
5. Start over — Repeat every January

## Why We Built LogLife

LogLife eliminates all of this friction. With a simple message, you get:

- Chat-native journaling through WhatsApp, Telegram, or any platform you already use
- Voice-first capture — just send a voice note about your day
- AI that transcribes, tags, and organizes everything automatically
- Daily/weekly/monthly highlights surfaced without effort

## The Reality

Most people just want to remember what they did and see how they're progressing. They don't want to spend time formatting entries or navigating complex apps.

We've handled the friction so you can focus on what matters: living your life and capturing the moments that count.
