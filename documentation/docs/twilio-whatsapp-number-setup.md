# Twilio WhatsApp Number Setup

- Open Twilio, pick a phone number, and click "Buy."

- In Twilio, open Messaging > Senders > WhatsApp Senders, then click "Create sender."

- Choose a Twilio phone number for WhatsApp and continue.

- If already using WhatsApp: open WhatsApp and change the phone number in Settings to this Twilio number.
    - If don't: create a WhatsApp account on a local number first, then change the number in Settings to the Twilio number.

- Twilio gets the verification code. Input the code in WhatsApp to complete number verification.

- Log in to WhatsApp again with the twilio number:
    - Option 1: Uninstall WhatsApp, reinstall it, and log in with the same number.
    - Option 2: Use another WhatsApp app (e.g., WhatsApp Business) and log in with the same number.

- That's all set!
