## The Tuesday Problem

Here's a question that sounds simple: What did you do last Tuesday?

Most people can't answer it. Not because their memory is bad—because nothing captured it. We live in an era of infinite data, infinite tools, infinite apps—and yet nobody can reconstruct their own week.

This isn't a memory problem. It's a **capture problem**.

## Memory Is Lossy by Design

Our brains weren't built to be recording devices. They evolved to spot patterns, detect threats, and make quick decisions. The details of your Tuesday—the conversation you had, the small win at work, the walk you took—fade within hours unless something makes them stick.

Journaling apps have tried to solve this. But most of them treat it like homework: open the app, stare at a blank page, try to remember, type something, feel guilty about not writing enough, close the app. Repeat (or more likely, don't).

The problem isn't discipline. The problem is friction.

## What's Missing in Today's World

Think about where your life data currently lives:

- **Notes** scattered across 10 different apps
- **Voice memos** that never get transcribed
- **New Year's resolutions** forgotten by February
- **No link** between your sleep, mood, and productivity
- **No one place** to ask: "How am I actually doing?"

We have all this technology, all this data, all this everything—and we can't tell someone what we did two days ago. What are we doing?

## Capture, Don't Recall

The solution isn't a better memory. It's a better **system**.

LogLife treats your life as a capture problem. Instead of asking you to recall and write, it meets you where you already are—your chat apps—and lets you talk.

A voice note at the end of your day. A quick text when something happens. That's it.

The AI handles the rest:
- **Transcribes** your voice into text
- **Tags and organizes** without you pressing buttons
- **Surfaces highlights**—the 3–5 most important things from your day, week, month, quarter, and year

No mood ratings. No structured input. No buttons. Just your words.

## The D/W/M/Q/Y Timeline

Imagine being able to look back and see:

- Your **daily** highlights—what actually mattered today
- Your **weekly** summary—patterns emerging
- Your **monthly** themes—what you've been focused on
- Your **quarterly** progress—are you moving toward your goals?
- Your **yearly** story—the narrative of your life, captured

This is what LogLife builds for you, automatically. The AI chooses the highlights (prioritizing what you emphasize and your stated goals), and you can always refine.

## From Scattered to Storyboard

The vision is simple: **the 80-20 simplest way to get your life on a storyboard**.

Not a productivity system. Not a habit tracker with 47 features. Not a therapy chatbot.

A capture system. Because remembering your life shouldn't depend on your memory—it should be reconstruction from captured data.
