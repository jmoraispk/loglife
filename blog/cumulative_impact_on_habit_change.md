## 📊 The Science of Habit Change

### [30%] Define & Track Daily
Write down the specific habit you want and track it every day. People who write down goals are about **42% more likely** to achieve them[^1]. Those who tracked their food lost **twice as much weight** as those who didn’t[^2].

**Takeaway:** Clarity + tracking = momentum.

---

### [+20%] Know Your WHY
List your personal reasons for the change and revisit them whenever motivation dips. When habits align with your **identity** (e.g. *“I am a runner”*), adherence improves by ~32%[^3].

**Takeaway:** *“He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.”* – Nietzsche

---

### [+15%] Schedule It
Plan the **when, where, and how**. Known as “implementation intentions,” this approach can boost follow-through dramatically. In one study, **91% of planners exercised** vs just 35% of non-planners[^4].

**Takeaway:** A habit without a time is just a wish.

---

### [+10%] Design Your Environment
Half of our actions are cued by context, not choice[^5]. Remove cues for bad habits and add cues for good ones. Even small changes (e.g. keeping fruit visible, hiding snacks) can raise success rates by ~58%[^6].

**Takeaway:** Shape the world around you to make the right choice automatic.

---

### [+10%] Notice Triggers & Feelings
Track what happens **before and after** lapses or wins. Recognize the *cue → routine → reward* loop[^7]. Once you know your triggers, you can replace routines with healthier responses.

**Takeaway:** Awareness precedes change.

---

### [+8%] Reward Small Wins
Immediate rewards make habits form **1.8× faster**[^8]. Celebrate each step—stickers, checkmarks, or just savoring the feeling.

**Takeaway:** What gets rewarded gets repeated.

---

### [+5%] Forgive Slip-Ups
Slip-ups are part of the process. Self-compassion leads to better recovery: dieters who forgave themselves after a lapse ate **less candy** than those who felt guilty[^9].

**Takeaway:** Progress, not perfection.
